# 🎬 Demo Script - Venezuelan Express AR Experience

Use this script when showing off your AR t-shirt to friends, customers, or at events!

---

## 🎯 The 30-Second Demo

### **Setup** (5 seconds)
1. Open the app on your phone
2. Tap "Scan Logo" tab
3. Allow camera access

### **The Reveal** (25 seconds)
1. Point camera at the Venezuelan Express logo on the t-shirt
2. Say: *"This uses advanced template matching to detect the actual logo pattern..."*
3. **Watch the confidence meter** - it shows the match percentage in real-time
4. **Hold steady** for 3-5 seconds - needs 75%+ match to lock
5. Watch the 3D logo appear in augmented reality:
   - Logo only appears when pattern matches at 75%+ confidence
   - "Logo Locked" badge appears with sparkle animation
   - Pops out forward in true 3D space
   - Realistic lighting and metallic material
   - Stable position locked in 3D
6. **Move away** from the logo - confidence drops and it disappears
7. Say: *"The system uses normalized cross-correlation - it's matching the actual pixel patterns, not just colors. This prevents false positives and only shows the AR when the real logo is detected."*
